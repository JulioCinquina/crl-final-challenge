# Conquering Responsive Layouts â€” Final Challenge

This repository contains my solution to the final challenge of Kevin Powell's [Conquering Responsive Layouts course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts).

## Some Highlights

- The primary navigation bar becomes a toggle menu on small screens;
  - The menu opens automatically when one of its items receives focus via the tab key;
  - Accessibility: when visually hidden, the primary navigation is still visible to screen readers;
- If a user's browser has a bigger default font size, the content can wrap into new lines to prevent overflow;
- The content is stacked on small screens but spreads out horizontally on larger screens.
